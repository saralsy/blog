Hello and welcome to my website! I am Sara Siye Liu, student @NYU Stern, insurtech startup founder, tech enthusiast, Singaporean. I believe in creating a better future by harnessing the power of technology into business. One cannot do without the other.

On this blog, I will mainly post three types of content:
* Personal projects (in [Projects]("./projects"))
* Reflection on world affairs (in [Blogs](./blogs))
* Science news (coming Fall 2020)

I want this blog to document the journey I take to find different portals, whether it be in science or in tech. There are so many things I want to learn, explore. I am still not sure what I want to specialize after graudation because everything seems interesting! 

## I am a student

I study Business (Finance) + CS at NYU.
I love reading, hoarding books.

## I am an entrepreneur

I started my first e-commerce store in Singapore while I was 15. Organizing inventory, raising cash from my mom as the sole investor, figuring out a way to receive payment when I didn't have a bank account thus concealing cash in envelope were ways I hacked my way to make business profitable. 

This entreprenerial spirit has been with me forever!

I then went on to participate in several startup pitching challenges (e.g semi-finalist for NYU 300K entrepreneur challenge, Top 10 U.S. National Finalist for L'Oreal brandstorm)
Fun, rewarding and exhilaring experience everytime I get to create, re-imagine and put to work some of me and my friends' ideas!

## I am a tech enthusiast.

I will show you what I can do in the project folder.
