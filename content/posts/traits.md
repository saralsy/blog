Growing up, I always feel at odds with myself and the people surrounding me. Full of imagination, I like to discuss wild and impractical ideas with my family and friends. This is how the entrepreneurial spirit is seeded when I was young. 

It sprouted when I first started my e-commerce stationery shop in Singapore while I was 15. My mom is the first backer of my little venture. We bought wholesale stationery from Chine Taobao, then used Carousell to distribute to students and working professionals.

This fire for new ideas then led me to study in New York at the vibrant New York University - Stern School of Business. I met my co-founder at a pitch bootcamp and here we go, we started an insurtech startup, trying to connect all the players in the insurance space (long overdue for something that is so essential for financial security).

I am looking for more startup ideas. Outside school, work, I like to ruminate about economy, philosophy and what it takes to have a meaningful life.

Thank you for finding me in the crowded internet space. 

Welcome to my crib!
