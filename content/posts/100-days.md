# :100:Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 18, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learned JavaScript, pop(), push(), shift(), unshift()

**Thoughts:** Very similar to Java, wonder what's the point of creating JavaScript, may be it works better on the web?

console.log()  | System.out.println()
---------------|---------------------
function       | output type
var            | output type

### Day 1: June 27, Monday (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
