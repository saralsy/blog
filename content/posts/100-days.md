# :100:Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 27, Monday 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

2. [Title Case a Sentence](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/title-case-a-sentence)

### Day 1: May 18, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I 've learned JavaScript, pop(), push(), shift(), unshift()

**Thoughts:** Very similar to Java, wonder what's the point of creating JavaScript, may be it works better on the web?

JavaScript     | Java
---------------|---------------------
console.log()  | System.out.println()
function       | output type
var            | output type

### Day 2: May 19, 2020, Tuesday 

**Today's Progress**: Still learning basic JavaScript, scope = visibility of variables on FreeCodeCamp. Doing Numpy tutorial 

**Thoughts** Can't wait to put the code together to form my javascript project!

### Day 3: May 24, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: just finished my first hackathon. It was an incredibel experience and I can still feel the surge in adrenaline as I look at our final product and demo video. It was tons of learning different languages and techniques in such a short amount of time. I also had a glimpse of software development and have a better appreciation of different roles / talent that is needed to make the product work and be loved by users.
